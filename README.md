# cucumber-boilerplate

This repository contains basic configurations of the [Cucumber](https://cucumber.io)
functional testing framework in a bunch of languages:

- [JavaScript]()
- [Java]()
- [Ruby]()

## Why use Cucumber?

Cucumber makes [functional testing](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Functional_testing)
easy. If you're a developer who works with formal [business requirements](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Business_requirements), or
with [user stories](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/User_story), Cucumber can help you ensure those requirements are
fulfilled.

## What does each directory contain?

For each language environment, I've included environment-specific files,
like `package.json` for JavaScript, `Gemfile` for Ruby, and `POM.xml` for Java.

Each folder has a `README` file that describes how to get started with Cucumber,
install dependencies, and write tests.

## I don't like these. I want to make better ones?

Please do open issues, ask questions, and improve this stuff in any way you like!
Thanks for reading!
